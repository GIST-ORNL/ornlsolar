This folder contains subfolders with data, code, and a final report corresponding to a project related to mapping solar panels, classifying them as commercial and residential,
and providing recommendations for future work focused on better understanding solar adoption patterns. The "code" and "data" subfolders contain additional readme files and data 
dictionaries (when appropriate) describing the contents in each folder and subfolder. It is recommended that anyone interested in this work first read the final report in the 
"report" subfolder.
